# Google Cloud Workstations - Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites
- Google Cloud SDK (gcloud) installed and authenticated
- An existing Cloud Workstations cluster and configuration

## Setup (one-time)

1. Configure your settings:
   cp config.example.sh config.sh
   vim config.sh  # Set your cluster, config, region

2. Make scripts executable:
   chmod +x wks.sh wks-image.sh

## Basic Workstation Commands

# List all workstations
./wks.sh list

# Start your workstation
./wks.sh start wks1

# SSH into workstation
./wks.sh ssh wks1

# Stop workstation
./wks.sh stop wks1

## Build Custom Image with Kilo Code AI

1. Generate Dockerfile (includes Kilo Code by default):
   ./wks-image.sh scaffold --base code-oss

2. (Optional) Edit Dockerfile to add more tools:
   vim Dockerfile

3. Build and deploy the image:
   ./wks-image.sh deploy --tag v1.0.0

4. Restart workstation to use new image:
   ./wks.sh restart wks1

## All-in-One Deployment

# Build, push, and update config in one command:
./wks-image.sh deploy --tag v1.0.0

# Then restart your workstation:
./wks.sh restart wks1

## Available Commands

wks.sh:
  list              List all workstations
  start <name>      Start a workstation
  stop <name>       Stop a workstation
  restart <name>    Restart (to apply new image)
  ssh <name>        SSH into workstation
  status <name>     Show workstation status
  create <name>     Create new workstation
  delete <name>     Delete a workstation (with confirmation)

wks-image.sh:
  scaffold          Generate Dockerfile from base image
  build             Build container image
  push              Push to Artifact Registry
